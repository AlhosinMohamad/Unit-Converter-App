# Unit-Converter-App

The Unit Converter App is a versatile and user-friendly application developed using Kotlin, showcasing modern Android development practices such as MVVM Clean Architecture, Coroutines, Room Database, Jetpack Compose, Hilt, LiveData, and ViewModel. This app provides a seamless and intuitive experience for users to convert various units across different categories.

Key Features:

1- MVVM Clean Architecture:
The app follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture for clear separation of concerns and maintainability.
Clean Architecture principles are applied to ensure a scalable and modular codebase.

2- Coroutines:
Asynchronous programming is handled efficiently using Kotlin Coroutines, ensuring smooth and responsive user interactions.

3- Room Database:
The app employs Room Database for local data storage, enabling fast and efficient retrieval of conversion history and preferences.

4- Jetpack Compose:
The modern UI framework, Jetpack Compose, is utilized for building a declarative and reactive user interface, resulting in a more straightforward and maintainable UI code.

5- Hilt (Dagger 2):
Dependency injection is managed through Hilt, simplifying code and enhancing testability while providing a scalable and maintainable architecture.

6- LiveData and ViewModel:
LiveData is used to observe data changes and update the UI accordingly, enhancing the overall user experience.
ViewModel is employed to manage UI-related data and handle the communication between the UI and the underlying data layers.
